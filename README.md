## Resources

| Name | Description | Link |
| ------ | -------- | ------ |
| Elements of Programming Interviews in Python | Probably my favorite book for programming interviews, problem sets are more on the intermediate to hard level, but it's more relatable to something you might see on an interview | [Amazon](https://a.co/d/928ptwD) |
| NeetCode 150 Roadmap | A curated problem set categorized based on topics | [NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) |
| Grind75 | 75 most-famous LeetCode questions | [Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75/) |
| Fundamental DSA Theory | A playlist made by Greg Hogg of the fundamentals data structures you have to know | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKYEe2WisBTGq9T0wPulXz1otUsVeOGey) |

## My Advice

:books: Here are some of my personal advice coming from a student and a total beginner, trying to learn DSA:
- It's best to start studying according to topics. In other words, master each topic (like arrays, then strings, then binary search, etc.) before jumping onto the next one. Of course, if you have, say, 5 days before your interview, your best bet is with Grind75.
- To continue with the approach I mentioned above, EPI is a very good resource (in the sense that you can really master a topic just by doing the chapter).
- For each question, start by giving yourself 20 minutes to solve it on your own. If you can't, then see the solutions and study them deeply. If you have no intuition/completely lost in the first 10 minutes, also look at the solutions. It's good if you do take the time and sit with it for a while. But, it could also be too time-consuming. I think for each question, you should be wise to either choose "is it one of those times where I can actually solve it given more time" or "I'm not making progress". 
- Even after solving a problem, always ask analyze the time complexity & space complexity of your answer. Then read/figure out the optimized solution.
- Have lots of mock interviews with your friends; this is how you pass your technicals. When no one is available to help me out, I reach out on LinkedIn (some people did end up helping me out!) or I just pick a random question and talk it out loud as if I'm in an interview.
- I've asked around, and software engineers who really have made it to the top said that it takes about 1 year to be really interview-ready or equivalent to ~500 LC questions that are mostly medium/hard difficulty.
- Be consistent. Maintain a streak (I use Google Calendar).
